## Overview

> **Quoty for Today** is a simple app built using Flutter, designed to help use generate a random quote for today.

## Features
- Get a random quote for today
- Translate your quote to Arabic
- Set a background for your quote 
- Save your favorite quotes
- Share your quote to others

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your command prompt and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WafaaSisalem/random-quote.git
2. Open the project folder and run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
3. Since we're using Riverpod Code Generation run this command in the terminal to generate the files:
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build
4. You will encounter an error in the `api_helper.dart` file. This is because the app uses two APIs:

   - **Unsplash API**: To fetch random pictures.
   - **Gemini API**: To translate the quotes.
   
   You need to set your own API keys by following these steps:
   
   1. Create a new Dart file named `my_keys.dart` in the `lib` folder.
   2. Add the following code to the file, replacing the placeholders with your actual API keys:
      ```dart
      const apiKey = 'your gemini api key';
      const unsplashKey = 'your unsplash api key';
5. Where to get these keys?
   - **Gemini API Key**: Refer to the [Gemini API Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).
   - **Unsplash API Key**: Follow the steps in the [Unsplash API Documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation).
   
   If you find it hard to get the API keys, feel free to contact me, and Iâ€™ll help you out.
   
   Once you've added your API keys, connect your device or emulator and run the app:
   
   ```bash
   flutter run
